        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Internet is amongst the most important technologies humanity has created. It's enabled millions of
            people to communicate and connect with each other, became the largest marketplace for all goods and services,
            has tons of websites filled with information, and much more. Despite its capabilities though, no one really
            "controls" the Internet.</p>
            <p>The idea of computer networks was considered science fiction back in mid-20th century, alongside the aliens
            and ray guns you'd see in movies. At the time, real computers were huge, room-sized, unwieldy, expensive
            devices that weren't intended to communicate with one another.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>The Space Race</h3>
            <p>With Soviet developments in launching the Sputnik satellite, the first artificial satellite to reach
            space, United States president Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
            division to further the American effort with the Space Race. The organization focused on the space program,
            which included computer science. The space program eventually got its own division though, that being the
            National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), leaving the computer programming on its own.</p>

            <p>One of ARPA's tasks was to create an indestructible communications network that would counter any Soviet
            offense, ensuring that America would be able to communicate with each other regardless of any damaged
            infrastructure. This task was headed by Paul Baran, computer engineer, whom thought of creating a
            "fishnet" network, where there would be many types of paths that transmitted information can take, even
            when parts of the network were damaged. Information was also chopped up into smaller bits called "packets."
            Packets were given a to/from address, and traveled through the network in the fastest possible path. They met
            with nodes along the way, which would direct where they would go as well as keep copies of the packet to
            continuously send them out until the next node successfully recieves them. Upon reaching its destination, the
            information was rebuilt from the packets to be used.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>ARPANET</h3>
            <p>The first computer network was built in 1969. The idea behind it was from Bob Taylor, a worker within ARPA,
            whom was frustrated with needing to move from terminal to terminal to operate every machine; he had the idea
            of operating said machines using just one terminal. With a backing of one million dollars from ARPA and the
            assistance of Larry Roberts, the man who developed the first experimental connection between two computers
            at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, they got to work.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>Taylor's idea was to develop a "mini-computer" called the Inferface Message Processors (IMP) to
                    connect to each mainframe machine, which the IMPs were connected with each other through packet
                    switching. Initially, there were problems with the concepts, like with communication companies not
                    buying into the idea, or more technical ones like packets possibly circulating the network forever.</p>
                    <p>Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) were tasked with creating the packet-switching communication
                    system, while graduate students at UCLA (led by Stephen Crocker) were tasked with writing the software that allows the IMPs
                    to communicate with its mainframe computer. The project was rushed and took about nine months, but
                    the outcome was the creation of the ARPANET, the first computer network.</p>
                    <p>By the end of 1969, ARPANET had four mainframe computers set up as nodes. By mid-1971, there were
                    eighteen.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>ARPANET Software</h3>
            <p>The first "killer app" of ARPANET was email. Developed by Raymond Tomlinson, he developed his own system
            for a single computer, which he used to send messages from himself to different users on the same computer.
            With some ingenuity and free time, he reprogrammed it into what we know as the email. The email also
            created the usage of the "@" symbol for the first time.</p>
            <p>The Internet was designed with an open architecture for things like this to happen. With the inclusion
            of new users over time, the development of the Internet kept growing. With the drive of the academic community,
            early Internet culture was about having many people contributing towards it to built something perfect. With
            ARPANET's showcase at the International Computer Communications Conference in 1972, it had over twenty different
            features to showcase. The conference itself furthered interest in computer networks, multiplying them throughout
            the Western world.</p>
            <p>Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs), or localized computer networks, began to prop
            up in places, but the issue with them is that each one was speaking their own "language," like a foreign
            country. Because of this, Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop a set of procedures
            called the TCP/IP protocol, which aided in creating a uniform set of rules for computer networks to follow.
            This helped computer networks open up and communicate with each other, becoming more interconnected. By 1983,
            TCP/IP was adopted as a universal standard, marking a milestone in the development of the Internet. To
            paraphrase Vint Cerf, the Internet 'works' because of the effort made to achieve commonality between computer
            networks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container mt-5 mb-5">
            <h3>World Wide Web</h3>
            <p>ARPANET was originally created as a tool for military research, and as such was limited to certain
            universities and think tanks whom were involved with government projects. Because of this, private networks
            began to prop up to involve the regular individual with the Internet, such as American Online or AOL. This
            was further enhanced when Congress acted to take Internet out of the exclusive hands of government and into
            the public; this was signed into law by George Bush Sr. Free enterprise and individual usage allowed for
            unimaginable uses for the Internet.</p>
            <p>While the public could start using the Internet, it was initially quite difficult to do so; there were a
            few things that eventually made it easier though. One was the development of the World Wide Web system,
            developed by Tim Berners-Lee, which made it easier to follow websites throughout the Internet. Another
            important milestone was the development of the web browser "Mosaic," by Marc Andreessen. It was the first
            user-friendly, graphical interface, but not the first web browser. This alone was a breakthrough, growing the
            Internet's overall network by over 341,000%.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the development of the Internet was a slow, brick-by-brick building process that truly
            reinvented communications of all kinds, and drives how we communicate today.</p>
