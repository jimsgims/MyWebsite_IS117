            <p class="text-large">If you ever wanted to become anonymous, this guide goes over some of the easiest and most extreme
            ways an individual can go private on the Internet. For a frame of reference, the average person should at
            the very least be following the basic measures, with the more concerned person taking the intermediate
            measures. The advanced and extreme measures are for people whom are passionate about online privacy and
            want to keep themselves practically off the grid. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Use a password manager and keep all your passwords you use for all
                    the website you visit inside of it.</strong> Your passwords need to be strong; strong passwords have
                    a lot of numbers, letters, and symbols. A password manager will generate passwords for you, but you
                    will still need to <strong>remember a master password</strong> for your password manager.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>The web browser you use. For a basic measure, you can use whatever
                    browser you want</strong>, be it Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Opera, or any other web browser.
                    If you install any addons to your browser though, make sure it is a trusted source. Finally, you will
                    want to switch your search engine (the websites like Google or Yahoo!) to something more secure like
                    duckduckgo or startpage.</li>
                </div>

            </div>

            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>2-Factor Authentication.</strong> This is an additional security
            measure after you input your password for a website. This is typically in the form of a text
            message, but lately companies are transitioning to an app called <strong>Google Authenticator</strong>.
            The latter is more secure, but either methods will help you secure your accounts.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Get a VPN (Virtual Private Network).</strong> This software will
            be able to hide your identity on the services you visit, and no one will be able to accurately track
            you through your IP address (your digital address). <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> is a good
            option for a VPN service, and costs very little for your total privacy.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Minimize your social media usage.</strong> This might not be as
            hard at your age, but you'll want to keep as little information about yourself on your social
            media profiles as you can. <strong>No real names, addresses, phone numbers, et cetera.</strong>
            Don't talk to strangers, don't comment on public posts, don't post pictures of yourself, and for
            phones, turn off any permissions for things you don't use, like tracking location or SMS text
            messages.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Don't put your phone number out there.</strong> If you need to
            input a phone number when signing up at a website, consider spoofing your phone number that'll
            redirect any incoming calls to your phone.</li>
            <li class="text-large text-justify"><strong>For your smartphones and computers,</strong> disable any settings that use
            your digital data, disable location services and Bluetooth, and remove any unused or unnecessary applications.</li>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h2 class="text-success">Intermediate Measures</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Used encrypted text messaging.</strong> To put it simply, you'll
                    want to use secure services like iMessage (built into your iPhone) or <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a>.
                    Signal is fully encrypted, ensuring that you and the person you’re texting are the only people that
                    have access to your conversation. This service also works for phone calls.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Secure your hard drive storage.</strong> If you didn't know,
                    whenever you delete your files on your computer, they don't actually disappear permanently. Instead,
                    it just opens up more free space that allows new data to overwrite the deleted data. If you want to
                    prevent anyone from accessing your deleted data, you'll want to get a program like
                    <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/docs/ccleaner/using-ccleaner/wiping-free-disk-space">CCleaner</a>
                    to <strong>clean up your free-space storage.</strong> Finally, you'll want to encrypt your hard drive
                    with something like BitLocker, a service included with Windows operating systems. Check
                    <a href="https://www.securicy.com/blog/how-to-encrypt-a-hard-drive-with-bitlocker-in-windows-10/">this guide</a>

            </div>

            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Change your email provider to something much more secure.</strong>
                Most email providers invade your privacy in some way, so you'll want to use a different service like
                <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, which is open-source and has end-to-end encryption,
                making it very secure. If you have difficulty with switching with email providers, check this guide
                <a href="https://www.techlicious.com/tip/move-to-new-email-account/">here</a>.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Get a smartphone with constant security updates.</strong> Between
                Androids and iPhones, the average individual will want an iPhone to be more secure, as most of Apple's
                phone models get constant security updates, where many Android products do not. Later on though, if
                you really want to up your online security game, you'll pick an Android product, which we'll go over
                later in this list.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Only use traditional passwords.</strong> Traditional passwords in this
            sense are the ones with letters and numbers and such. Do NOT use any type of other security for your
            passwords. This means things like fingerprints, face scans, PINs, et cetera. For a bonus, you should
            also make sure the router you use at home isn't using the default password it comes with.</li>
            <li class="text-large text-justify"><strong>Use a privacy-based browser.</strong> You'll want to use new web browsers such
            as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. Avoid Google Chrome and any other
            chromium-based browsers as they collect your private data. You would also be better off getting some web
            extensions that help block online advertisements
            (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Ublock Origin</a>) and prevent
            tracking (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/">Privacy Badger</a>).</li>

            <h2 class="text-warning">Advanced Measures</h2>
            <p class="text-large text-justify">From this point onward, these measure may be out of the realm for the
            average elderly person to care about. Don't worry, but if you're a real enthusiast about online privacy,
            keep reading!</p>

                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Change your computer's operating system.</strong>
                    The following operating system types are ranked from worst to best for security: Windows, OS X,
                    Linux Guest, Linux. Get a Linux-based operating system such as Lubuntu, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, or Fedora.
                    If you're hesitant, try out the operating system on a virtual machine (a computer within your
                    computer) to see if you'll like it.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Ditch your current smartphone.</strong> One of the alternatives
                    is a basic flip phone that has no SMS feature, as texting on them wouldn't have any encryption. Another is
                    an Android device with a custom privacy-oriented ROM. It's not important to know too much of what that is,
                    but <a href="https://copperhead.co/android/">Copperhead OS</a> is a perfect example of one. With your
                    Android device, you'll want no Google services installed (you'll have to download new apps with the
                    <a href="https://www.f-droid.org/">F-Droid Store</a>) and you'll want to disable Bluetooth entirely.</li>

            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Ditch Google and social media.</strong> This might not be
            too hard for your age group, but for the rest of the world, this is a very unlikeable step in the process of
            reaching total online anonymity. Google and social media websites are complete hotbeds for data extraction,
            and are essentially the antithesis to seeking total online privacy.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Password-protect your BIOS.</strong> The BIOS of
            your computer is important for providing services for operating systems and programs. Protecting it
            will ensure no one can get access to your computer's core systems and modify anything within it.</li>
            <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Only use the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>
            as your new web browser.</strong> It is one of the only web browsers to securely encrypt your traffic and
            mask your IP address whenever you're visiting a website. It makes great efforts in doing so, unlike any other
            widely-known web browser. The Tor Browser is available on your computer, but you can look for alternatives
            on your phone such as Orbot and Orfox for Android devices, and Red Onion for iPhones; Firefox Focus is an
            alternative too.</li>
            <li class="text-large text-justify"><strong>Spend money online anonymously.</strong> There are a couple ways
            you can do this. One is purchasing pre-paid debit cards (in cash), and activating them with false information.
            You can use the Tor Browser as mentioned above to anonymize your traffic, so no worries if you're lying.
            Another method is using cryptocurrency; apps like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> can help
            you with learning how to do so. The issue with cryptocurrency is that many websites do not support them yet,
            as they're generally unregulated and not backed by governments.</li>

                    but when people are looking for information on you, they'll likely look to people close to you or
                    contact you directly. To avoid this, don't talk to strangers, never give out real personal info
                    anywhere (online or in real life), and even go as far as to change your speech patterns. Similar
                    phrases and catchphrases CAN and WILL be tracked.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2 text-large text-justify"><strong>Spoof your MAC address.</strong> Your MAC address identifies
                    the "address" of the device you're currently using. If you spoof it, you'll make yourself more anonymous
                    to whatever network you're connecting to.

            It goes without saying, but this is the most extreme step you can take. You'll want to undertake a number of
            things in order to assure your privacy at this stage. First, you'll want to <strong>fill your e-mail with mail
            bombers</strong>, filling them up with random junk mail INTENTIONALLY. Next, <strong>with all of your accounts, upload
            random pictures of random people and make up information for them.</strong>This makes it hard to determine who
            the account belongs to and much harder to connect them back to you. Finally, <strong>delete as many accounts
            as possible.</strong> If you can't do so with some websites, email the service directly as in most cases they
