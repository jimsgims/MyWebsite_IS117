            <h3>e-Commerce</h3>
            <p>The internet brought about the age of online shopping, changing how we buy and sell things with websites
            like Amazon and eBay. Amazon was launched in mid-1995 by founder Jeff Bezos, whom was obsessed with spreadsheets
            and the idea of selling books online. eBay was launched around the same time by Pierre Omidyar, but he was
            the complete opposite of Bezos in terms of professionalism; Bezos had an extremely intricate business plan
            in place backed by market research when starting his website, while Omidyar was simply fascinated behind his
            idea, putting no further thought into making it than that.</p>
            <p>eBay held the belief that an auction site online would be fairer and more accessible than any existing
            market in the physical world. Initially, the site was boggled down with seemingly useless junk that people
            were selling, mostly due to its popularity with people whom collected things. Regardless, Omidyar was raking
            in thousands of dollars worth of fees within months of launching the website. Bezos himself was doing much
            better, shipping books to over 45 states in the US and to over 50 countries worldwide within a month of
            launching Amazon. His initial business plan called for slow growth, but was modified quickly due to how
            quickly users were latching onto the site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>What drives the growth for the Internet?</h3>
            <p>There's a few things that really exploded how effective and fast the Internet became.</p>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Moore's Law</strong> is a concept that correctly predicts that technology progress of
            microprocessors will double in efficiency roughly every two years. This is important for the development
            of newer, faster computers.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Metcalfe's Law</strong> states that every new node added to the network increases
            its efficiency, making it more useful and becomes more compelling for new users to join the network. The
            more popular that computers and the Internet were becoming, the more powerful it can become.</li>
            <p>Overall, the Internet was really taking off in the late 1990s, with rampant enthusiasm and unbridled
            greed taking the wheel and bringing about a bubble of economic growth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>The Bubble</h3>
            <p>To summarize, a "bubble" in American economics have started with risky start-ups and eager investors, and
            end with many bankruptcies, foreclosures, and stock market immolation. It's happened throughout our history
            with industries such as railroads, but where it started on the Internet was with Netscape's "Navigator"
            browser. Following it were the several search engines like Yahoo! and Excite!, and online stores like Amazon.
            For Amazon, their initial public offering in mid-1997 was somewhat dubious on the surface. The company wasn't
            very old at the time (about two years), there were precious few revenues, no profits.</p>


            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>Bezos made it an effort to hype up the company as much as possible though. His successes for Amazon come
                    from his business plan of foregoing short-term profits and revenue in exchange for rapid growth. Bezos coined
                    his plan with a motto: "Get big fast." The rapid growth leads to an obvious increased scale for operation, and
                    customers will trust the company for their effective service.</p>
                   <p>Speaking of trust, Amazon had the problem of how they were going to get customers' trust in giving
                   them their credit card information for online purchases. They wanted a near-perfect way to secure
                   their info and ensure they aren't picked up by hackers. The result was public key encryption, developed
                   by mathematicians Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle. An explanation of how it works
                   is on the right.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-JjHa-qLPk" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Back to eBay, their initial business model was hazy, collectors flooding the site with odd trinkets, making
            it unprofessional and reminiscent of a flea market. The company wanted to be taken serious, so they hired
            Meg Whitman, a marketer at Walt Disney and an executive at Hasbro. With her assistance, the initial
            public offering in late 1998 soared the first day.</p>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>Wall Street Frenzy</h3>
            <p>The trends with eBay and Amazon having crazy initial stock prizes wasn't uncommon during the .com bubble.
            People were in a frenzy purchasing stocks, with crazy investments being made into any company based on the
            Internet. Companies with no real business plan, poor purposes, or lacking profits still got investments.
            The successes of Amazon and eBay inspired thousands to imitate them and take a shot at the Internet business.
            It was practically the new-age Gold Rush. These prospective businesspeople focused less on profits and more
            on the potential money that their company's stock could generate from Wall Street.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the stock market was becoming more democratized; everyday people were getting more opportunities
            to participate in stocks through mediums like day traders. This mass intake of new participants in the
            stock market helped grow the fervent investments of crazy amounts of money into websites, all without the
            thought of consequences. People were giving this as much thought as if they were gambling, and at the time,
            they weren't too different from each other. This, in short, is what caused the .com bubble.</p>
            <p>Growth was so great for the Internet that fiber networks were being built across the country. These fiber
            networks were necessary so that computer networks could easily connect with one another. Because of this
            bubble, there was heightened interest to create these fiber networks for better connections. While not
            necessarily a bad thing, it's noteworthy that the companies layout out fiber networks were overdoing it;
            too many companies were doing the labor, there was a lot of overspending, and there wasn't much thought
            for costs or consequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5 mb-5">
            <h3>The Popping of the Bubble</h3>
            <p>Eventually, intervention was taken to try and pop this bubble. Federal Reserve head chairman Alan
            Greenspan, was initially favorable towards the bubble, stating that the technology behind the Internet was
            creating a new economy that is unlike anything we've experienced before. He did become more fearful of it
            though, fearing a total economic collapse, and by early 2000 he enacted higher federal interest rates in
            an effort to end the bubble.</p>
            <p>The bust on April 14th, 2000 was called "Black Friday." The NASDAQ fell 355 points in one week, making it
            one of the single greatest collapses in the stock market. It ended up losing two-thirds of its value from its
            $5000 peak. All in all, about $3.5 trillion was lost within a year.</p>
            <p>Black Friday was the conclusive end of the .com bubble. Many tech giants were wounded, but many more
            smaller websites went kaput. Wall Street was blamed for the over-hyping of companies, with New York Attorney
            General Elliot Spitzer leading prosecution against a few Wall Street executives over the ordeal.</p>
            <p>There were positives to the end of this bubble, though:</p>

            <li class="mb-2">Important technological progress was made with the websites whom survived the crash, and
            we now have companies whom benefit the economy with their new practices.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Helped empower regular people by giving them tools to what they want to achieve online.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">As stated by Andy Grove, president of Intel, untold sums of billions of dollars was spent in
            building up the Internet's infrastructure, such as the fiber networks mentioned above. These benefits may
            have come eventually, he mentioned, but the bubble made them happen in five years rather than fifteen.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Brick-and-mortar companies were practically forced to move online and become more involved
            with the Internet in order to stay afloat and compete.</li>

            <p>To conclude, the bubble and eventual crash shows the progression of how the Internet has developed for a
            worldwide economy, and how it’s revolutionizing it so efficiently and quickly. There were losers, but
            we all came out winners with the progress we made along the way.</p>
