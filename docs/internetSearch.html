            <h3>Before the search engine</h3>
            <p>Navigating the Internet was difficult in the past, and it took some time after its inception for a proper
            and efficient way was created to browse the web. Before, the Internet was simply a wall of links, categorized
            manually by the content of the websites. It was difficult and clunky, and finding specific results would
            take time.</p>
            <p>This changed when Jerry Yang and David Filo, Stanford University students went on a year-long sabbatical,
            where during that time they came up with an idea for a search engine, creating Yahoo!. Originally, they came
            up with the idea as they wanted to find better ways to use the Internet in collecting data for Stanford's
            fantasy basketball league. Collecting data on players and such was tedious work for the two; directories of
            websites were very crude, being compiled by regular people whom subjectively listed where websites' content
            were relevant.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>The early introduction of search engines was pretty controversial. At the beginning, it wasn't necessarily
                        used for any business or commerce, so the thoughts on its future was split into two groups. On one side, they
                        saw the prospect of free enterprise and capitalism flourishing on the Internet, but on the other side there
                        was the desire for complete freedom within the Internet, ensuring the free flow of information. With Yahoo!,
                        their initial difficulties involved getting the funding they needed; their business model was hazy, Yang and
                        FIlo were generally unprofessional individuals, and it was an unprecedented idea. Because of this, the two
                        decided to side with the capitalist group. They took money from venture capitalists, and they also started
                        to implement advertisements within their search engine. Advertisements on the Internet were unprecedented,
                        so initially they had fears that the ads would alienate their user base. After some time though, they had
                        discovered that they had no real effect on their user base, and Yahoo! still continued to grow.</p>
                    <p>By 1996, Yahoo faced an assortment of competitors gaining ground on them. One of them was called Excite!,
                        a considerably more sophisticated search engine created by Joe Kraus which content was purely organized by
                        software, allowing for much more detailed search function. The technology Excite! utilized is rudimentary
                        to what we have today.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <!--Image-->
                    <img src="images/yahoo.png" class="rounded image-fluid" style="max-width: 100%">
                    <p class="text-center mt-2">Yahoo!'s interface in its early days.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-2">With search engines like Yahoo and Excite!, many were turning themselves into hubs of
                sorts, with many added features such as stock trading, email, and a lot of shiny trinkets and baubles for
                features; these were not necessarily helpful features, but just there to make the search engine seem
                bigger and better. It was intended to captivate users more for the benefit of advertisers, but search engine
                began to focus less and less on the "search engine" features and getting worse.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>Google revolutionizes search</h3>
            <p>In 1998, Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who were also Stanford students. They started
            their search engine with the notion that the Internet is running a continuous "popularity contest," on content,
            and that the number of times a site is linked to by other sites could be a measurement of how popular and
            relevant said site was. For example, if a website was linked to by hundreds of thousands of other sites, it
            probably has a lot of traffic, where vice versa if it has only a couple dozen sites linking to it, it isn't
            very popular. Hector Garcia-Molina, one of Page and Brin's professors, helped them with the feature, calling
            it "ink-link count."</p>
            <p>Initial traffic for Google was so large, that Stanford reported that their university network had nearly
            crashed because of it, forcing the two founders to move off-campus to host their search engine. Of course,
            they were college students, so they needed to get funding. They went through a numerous amount of people and
            companies in doing so. They first went to Excite! who wanted to look into their technology and see if it's
            worth buying. They were impressed with it, but they decided against it as they didn't believe it'd be a
            profitable venture considering the oversaturation of already-existing search engines. Next, they reached out
            to a professor at Stanford (David Ceriton), whom referred them to Andy Bechtolsheim, a Silicon Valley
            investor. After a demo, Bechtolsheim was sold, stating "it ws the best idea I've seen in my entire life,"
            writing them a check to the duo immediately for $100k. Other investors followed, totalling around $1 million.
            John Doerr and Michael Moritz, venture capitalists, followed too and invested $12 million each.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>New way to advertise</h3>
            <p>With their investments, initial concerns came from investors due to a lack of a business plan; how does
            Google plan to make money? The easy answer would be advertisements, but Page and Brin refused to do the same
            as previous search engines, believing they would be intrusive and they wanted to set themselves apart from
            the hub-style that Yahoo and Excite! were doing.</p>
            <p>They met with Bill Gross, founder of the company Idealab, whom proposed the idea of having advertisements
            tailored to the search histories of users. Gross called them "keywords," and considered them very useful to
            show the intent of the user for market research. Initial concerns were over the legality of using user data,
            but Gross compared the idea to yellow pages, in which companies would pay to have their advertisements show
            up when users are looking for something in particular.</p>
            <p>Google met with Gross to discuss this, but they never struck up any kind of deal. Soon afterwards though,
            Google launched a very similar service to Gross's ideas called Adwords, essentially copying his software.
            Gross soon filed a lawsuit against Google, which led to a very profitable settlement for him. This new
            aspect for advertising though gave Google the edge to create a global marketplace, creating effective
            advertisements to users while giving any size of business, small or large, the ability to advertise on their
            search engine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5 mb-5">
            <h3>Prospects of Google</h3>
            <p>Google's initial public offering occurred in 2004, creating a frenzy of speculation and anticipation, with
            hope that they could revive the tech sector recovering from the .com crash. Whoever bought stocks at its
            opening has surely made great dividends; three years after their initial stock offering, Google was valued
            more than FedEx, McDonalds, Coke, Intel, IBM, or Walmart, making it one of the fastest growing companies
            ever. Page and Brin themselves now rank amongst the top thirty richest people in the world.</p>
            <p>Despite their power, Google states that it takes effort to ensure the company isn't seen like an overbearing
            bully, with their company motto being "Don't be evil." The company continues to grow, pouring its profits
            into countless new experiments, projects, and features all hosted by themselves.</p>
            <p>They continue to grow and many competitors and opposing forces aim to fight against them, but only the
            future holds what will happen to Google.</p>
