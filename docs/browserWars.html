            <h3>The Creation of Mosaic</h3>
            <p>The first graphical web browser began when two students from the University of Illinois became fascinated
            with the World Wide Web in 1993. One of them was Marc Andreessen, who thoroughly enjoyed the Internet and
            wanted to make it more easily intuitive to use, along with implementing image, audio, and video capabilites.
            This is the basis of what made Mosaic, and allowed the Internet to be that much more widely available to
            the public.</p>
            <p>The web browser had garnered interest from James H. Clark, a Silicon Valley rich guy whom led his own
            computer engineering company, whom thought Mosaic was an incredible business opportunity. He reached out to
            Andreessen, and the two of them went into business together, hiring students from the University of Illinois
            to help them develop the browser, and moved their newly-formed company to Silicon Valley.</p>

            <h3>Initial Conflicts</h3>
            <p>At the same time, Microsoft was a company headed by Bill Gates. It was an extremely profitable tech
            giant in the 1990s, whom had built a near-monopoly over PC operating systems over the past two decades. Gates'
            company was able to provide Microsoft-licensed software, and by 1993, about 90% of all computers in the world
            were running their software.</p>
            <p>In the process of this though, Microsoft was known to get their hands dirty with their competitive
            practices with similar tech companies. Many companies that faced them had been destroyed through Microsoft's
            capitalistic methods to snuff competition. Many of the company's employees were on the younger
            side, determined by aggressive competition. Alongside this, Gates was working with Steve Ballmer, whom was
            known to be a ruthless businessman.</p>
            <p>With the launch of the Mosaic web browser and the conception of its company, Netscape Communications,
            there was a clear competition between Netscape and Microsoft. Both companies had the dream of developing
            software that was extremely popular and widespread throughout the world. </p>
