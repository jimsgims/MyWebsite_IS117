            <h3>The Creation of Mosaic</h3>
            <p>The first graphical web browser began when two students from the University of Illinois became fascinated
            with the World Wide Web in 1993. One of them was Marc Andreessen, who thoroughly enjoyed the Internet and
            wanted to make it more easily intuitive to use, along with implementing image, audio, and video capabilites.
            This is the basis of what made Mosaic, and allowed the Internet to be that much more widely available to
            the public.</p>
            <p>The web browser had garnered interest from James H. Clark, a Silicon Valley rich guy whom led his own
            computer engineering company, whom thought Mosaic was an incredible business opportunity. He reached out to
            Andreessen, and the two of them went into business together, hiring students from the University of Illinois
            to help them develop the browser, and moved their newly-formed company to Silicon Valley.</p>

            <h3>Initial Conflicts</h3>
            <p>At the same time, Microsoft was a company headed by Bill Gates. It was an extremely profitable tech
            giant in the 1990s, whom had built a near-monopoly over PC operating systems over the past two decades. Gates'
            company was able to provide Microsoft-licensed software, and by 1993, about 90% of all computers in the world
            were running their software.</p>
            <p>In the process of this though, Microsoft was known to get their hands dirty with their competitive
            practices with similar tech companies. Many companies that faced them had been destroyed through Microsoft's
            capitalistic methods to snuff competition. Many of the company's employees were on the younger
            side, determined by aggressive competition. Alongside this, Gates was working with Steve Ballmer, whom was
            known to be a ruthless businessman.</p>
            <p>With the launch of the Mosaic web browser and the conception of its company, Netscape Communications,
            there was a clear competition between Netscape and Microsoft. Both companies had the dream of developing
            software that was extremely popular and widespread throughout the world. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>In 1994, Netscape launched its second web browser called Navigator, which was faster and better
                    than Mosaic. Its launch drove Microsoft to focus on competing with Netscape, to beat them out of
                    the market for good. By next year, the Internet started becoming a full-scale phenomenon, being
                    compared its importance to technologies like television or the printing press, and Netscape was
                    leading the charge.</p>
                    <p>Microsoft eventually reached out to Netscape, sending an envoy to talk with them. This meeting is
                    considered very controversial, with Microsoft and Netscape having very different perspectives on how
                    the meeting turned out. From the perspective of Thomas Reardon, part of the Microsoft envoy, he states
                    how the discussion between the two companies was free-though, with discussions over working together,
                    implementing their softwares with one another, and so-forth. Netscape's perspective was exactly the
                    opposite; they claimed that Microsoft tried to strong-arm them into a bad offer, threatening to
                    copy their technology and destroy their business. These tactics, if true, were clear violations of
                    antitrust laws on Microsoft's part. Because of this, Netscape hired Gary Reback, a lawyer who
                    specialized in antitrust law and was integral to fighting Microsoft with them.</p>

            <h3>Microsoft vs. Netscape</h3>
            <p>The discussion between Microsoft and Netscape led to discussions of taking Netscape public in the stock
            market. Even without a proper plan of how the company could make money, Wall Street could speculate that the
            company could be extremely profitable. Mary Meeker, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, stated she
            thought Netscape could be the fastest-growing software company ever. When the company went public, their stock
            went through the roof, igniting the Internet rage that lasted the rest of the 90s. James Clark personally made
            about $663 million from the initial trades. Andreessen and other Netscape executives became to be known for
            their constant boastful attitude towards Microsoft and their technology.</p>
            <p>Netscape's successes drove Microsoft to work even harder to compete with them. All their employees, all
            the products they made, all their efforts were done to destroy Netscape. The development of their new
            web browser, Internet Explorer, observed the implementations of Navigator and imitate what they do, but
            better. Microsoft's sales team was known to be shady and predatory, pressuring many of the PC manufacturers
            that they deal with to only utilize Microsoft software as well as stopping the distribution of Netscape's
            software. Furthermore, when Internet Explorer did release, Microsoft had packaged it with their own OS software,
            all for free. At the time, Netscape was charging users to use their browser, and couldn't compete with
            Microsoft given the incredibly large wealth gap between the two companies.</p>

                    <h3>The Winner Is ...</h3>
                    <p>Microsoft. By 1997, they emerged triumphant, claiming victory in the Browser Wars. The launch of Internet
                        Explorer version 4.0 showed usage of 80% of all computer users. Eventually, Netscape was on a downward spiral,
                        with their stocks dwindling to single-digit figures. The company was eventually acquired by AOL. Employees of
                        Netscape weren't totally upset about the ordeal; many of the employees became rich off of stock options when
                        they were high. James Clark himself had invested $5 million into the company overall, and had profited about
                        $2 billion. Despite this though, Netscape became a shadow of its former self.</p>
                    <p>Despite the victory, in 1998, Microsoft was under flak by the US Government for their heavy monopolistic practices
                        they used to drive out Netscape. The court proceedings recorded testimony from Bill Gates, whom was seen as
                        passive-aggressive, petulant, untruthful, et cetera. The lawsuit reccomended that Microsoft be broken up, but
                        a federal appeal easened the punishment. Afterwards, Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft, handing his
                        position over to Steve Ballmer, and focusing on more philanthropic efforts with his own private foundation.</p>
