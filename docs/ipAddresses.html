            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>The Internet's working protocols were developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, and were done to standardize
            a method for networks to communicate with each other. Their work is essentially the groundwork for the
            Internet. Behind it, its design philosophy and architecture are expressed in a set of protocols. Protocols
            are a well-known set of rules and standards used by machines to communicate with one another. These protocols
            are very useful for the Internet to adapt and absorb new communication technologies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container mt-5">
            <h3>How does communication work on the Internet?</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>Computers communicate with each other in a fashion similar to the postal service, but instead it
                    ships binary information in bits. Bits are the smallest unit of measurement for computer data. Eight
                    bits is equal to a byte; a thousand bytes is equal to a kilobyte, and a thousand kilobytes is equal
                    to one megabyte, and so forth.</p>
                    <p>Bits are sent by electricity, light, and radio waves. The transmission capacity for any device
                    to send bits is called bandwidth, and bandwidth is measured by its bitrate. Bitrate is the number
                    of bits per second a system can transmits. Lastly, latency is the time it takes for a bit to travel
                    from sender to receiver.</p>
                    <p>Data can travel through a variety of methods:</p>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Electric</strong> - cheap, signal loss over a few hundred feet</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Light</strong> - fast, no signal loss, expensive, hard to work with</li>
                    <li><strong>Radio</strong> - wireless, signal loss</li>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>All devices have a unique address, usually a set of numbers. This is specifically called an
                    internet protocol address, or IP for short. IPs are how devices can get addresses to send and
                    deliver messages over the Web. For example, if I wanted to visit a website on my phone, my phone
                    will ask for the IP address of the target computer which hosts the website, and said target
                    computer will deliver that information back so I can access it.</p>
                    <p>IP addresses follow a hierarchy under the IPv4 system. These traditional IP addresses are 32
                    bits in length, with 8 bits for each of the four parts of the address. The hierarchy starts from
                    the country, then region, then subnetwork, then device.</p>
                    <p>In our time, we are currently transitioning to a new hierarchy system called IPv6. Our current
                    IPv4 system has up to four billion combinations, but that is definitively not enough to supply
                    all of the devices existing in the world. IPv6 uses 128 bits per address, much more than before,
                    providing over 340 undecillion unique addresses.</p>

            <h3>How is data delivered?</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>There is no direct dedicated connection for every device, as this system would be impossible to
                    manage with the billions of devices participating throughout the world, even ignoring the fact that
                    the hypothetical infrastructure of it would be perfectly maintained at all times. Instead, data
                    travels through a much-less direct method. It doesn't travel in a fixed path, but rather through
                    "packets," which aim to take the best possible route to their destination based on obstacles and
                    traffic congestion.</p>
                    <p>Each packet can hold only a limited amount of data. Files that are transferred are usually broken
                    up into hundreds, if not thousands of packets. Each packet knows its destination, but all of them
                    travel in different directions for the most optimal path. Along the way, they travel through routers,
                    which act like "packet managers," so to speak. They ensure packets are moving to their destination,
                    sending them on the many paths available to them. This mesh-like network makes it fault-tolerant,
                    so that if some pathways are unavailable, there's always more paths to take.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>How is this data assured to be perfect when it arrives at its destination? For that, there's
                    something called the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP for short), which is like a "guaranteed mail
                    service," if you go back to the earlier postal service metaphor. TCP ensures all the packets are
                    delivered to its destination, checking that each and every packet arrived. If packets are missing,
                    then TCP ensures they're re-sent through the network. Once all the packets arrive, then the packets
                    are combined to recreate the file that was sent originally.</p>
                    <p>The TCP and router mesh network system is scalable, working with as many devices as it needs.
                    Since routers act as packet managers, then the more routers that are added to the system, the more
                    reliable a network actually becomes. Because of this, we can scale the Internet's infrastructure
                    without interrupting any current connections.</p>
                    <p>Overall, protocols ensure networks and devices connect, communicate, and collaborate with each
                    other because of the agreed-upon standards for how data is sent around the internet.</p>
