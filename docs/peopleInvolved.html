            <h3>Connected people</h3>
            <p>People strive to communicate above all else; before the Internet, people were subjugated to culture
            through mediums like newspapers or television, mediums that were controlled by large companies. With the
            revelation of the Internet, there's a new method of communication, allowing people to find information,
            speak their own, and collaborate with each other through a democratic-like medium.</p>
            <p>With the development of the Internet, a term was coined called Web 2.0; it's a term that emphasizes
            websites who host user-generated content, where users participate in the community through the information
            they put out themselves and the information they find from other users. The following people are examples
            of founders of websites of Web 2.0.</p>

                    <h3>Facebook</h3>
                    <p>Facebook emphasizes the way relationships are mapped out, and how many a single individual can
                    have given the people they're connected to. Zuckerberg believes that his website has the potential
                    to fundamentally change the Internet, creating an exponential growth in his user base. His ambition
                    for the site is to create a service that embodies the totality of human connectedness; in other
                    words, the "ultimate relationship engine."</p>
                    <p>The website maps out all types of relationships people have into a "social graph" where people
                    are bound together into a web of relationships. For example, if you have a friend on Facebook, and
                    if that friend has another friend on Facebook, then by the power of this "web," you have a relationship
                    with your friend's friend in some manner.</p>
                    <p>Facebook today is considerably powerful online, being a medium in which friends and families come
                    together to connect online through mutual interests and relationships. So powerful so that Microsoft
                    had invested $240 million into Facebook just for 1.6% shareholding power.</p>

                    <h3>YouTube</h3>
                    <p>YouTube is the main online video-sharing platform. The website makes efforts to "change the world"
                    through people-power, connecting indivduals (and making money) through the medium of video. For example,
                    the act of recording and sharing video had once many barriers to entry (mostly related to money), but
                    with YouTube it is now much more accessible with people being able to broadcast themselves through
                    whatever simple equipment they have on-hand. A camcorder is enough to share your favorite childhood
                    moments with the Internet.</p>
                    <p>YouTube hosts countless videos, including copyrighted contents from television and movies. In an
                    act to hurt the website, companies like Viacom spoke out against them, filing a lawsuit accusing them
                    of "brazen disregard for intellectual property law, because of the copyrighted material that appears
                    on the site." YouTube was able to stand its ground against threats like these though, due to their
                    acquirement by Google back in 2006 providing them lots of funds to do so.</p>

                    <h3>Napster</h3>
                    <p>Napster was a peer-to-peer program dedicated to online music distribution, and it was one of
                    the most popular ones on the Internet at its peak. The way it worked is that as long as someone,
                    somewhere connected to Napster had the MP3 file you were looking for, you could download it off
                    their computer. The program wasn't even officially downloadable at first, distributed manually from
                    Fanning, but its popularity exploded through America, passing over a million downloads after a few
                    months.</p>
                    <p>There were repercussions for distributing music online though. For one, it's illegal; it is
                    literally the distribution of copyrighted material. Of course, it was happening at a rate of tens
                    of millions of shared files per day, so it would be difficult go after individual users for participating
                    in it. The music industry, recording studios and artists alike, were against Napster during its
                    popularity. For instance, Metallica, the heavy-metal band, threatened to sue the site in 2000, asking them
                    to ban around three-hundred thousand users who engaged in distributing Metallica's music. The lawsuit
                    boosted the site's popularity and hurt Metallica's image. The Recording Industry Association of
                    America (RIAA) filed a lawsuit as well, accusing Napster of copyright infringement. The suit's verdict
                    was for the site to be shut down</p>
                    <p>Despite their shutdown, the supposed effects of online piracy still happened; music sales still
                    declined, and illegal file sharing still happened in great numbers. The site's legacy is how other
                    companies picked up where Napster left off, like Apple's iTunes.</p>
