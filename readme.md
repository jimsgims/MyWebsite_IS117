This is a website used to host some work I've done for the class IS 117 at NJIT.

### NEW:
- Project 1 has had some modifications to its pages for more suitable reading.
- A footer has been created for all pages
- Project 2 is completed!
- The additional navbar for both project pages has been removed, and reimplemented
into the main navbar.
